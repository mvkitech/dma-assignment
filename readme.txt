The code in this project was built with NodeJS using the VS-Code. The code 
is NOT connected to a database, and instead stores all of the data during 
a given HttpSession that it handles in memory. As long as you have Node.JS 
installed (I built it with version 12.5.0) all you need to down is download 
the project and run: "npm install" with no additional arguments.
